          <h2>About</h2>
          <article id="tribute-info">
          <p class="bio">Dervla Murphy was a pioneering Irish travel writer and adventurer, renowned for her solo journeys across some of the most challenging terrains in the world. Armed with little more than a bicycle, she traveled through remote regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, capturing the essence of the cultures and landscapes she encountered.</p>
   <p class="bio">Her first and most famous book, Full Tilt: Ireland to India with a Bicycle (1965), chronicled her audacious ride from Ireland to India, establishing her as a fearless traveler and a gifted storyteller. Over the decades, she authored more than 20 travel books, each marked by her keen observations, deep empathy, and unflinching honesty.</p>
   <p class="bio">Murphy’s work extended beyond travel writing; she was a passionate advocate for social justice, often focusing on the lives of the underprivileged and oppressed in the regions she visited. Her dedication to exploring the world on her terms, and her commitment to writing with integrity and insight, left a lasting impact on the world of travel literature and beyond.</p>

         <p class="bio"> “For my tenth birthday my parents gave me a second-hand bicycle and Pappa [her grandfather] sent me a second-hand atlas. Already I was an enthusiastic cyclist, though I had never before owned a bicycle, and soon after my birthday I resolved to cycle to India one day. I have never forgotten the exact spot, on a steep hill near Lismore, where this decision was made. Half-way up I rather proudly looked at my legs, slowly pushing the pedals around, and the thought came ‘If I went on doing this for long enough I could get to India.’” - Dervla Murphy</p>
